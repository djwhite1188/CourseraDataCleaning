==================================================================
This readme describes a dataset that combined and cleaned several dataset raw datasets of cell phone movement data. The data
combined testing and training datasets. merged the subject and activity descriptions. added the description of the activities.
Finally the data was reorganized to the "long" tidy form as recognized in the Coursera rubric. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- key of unique subject activity observation 
- activity label. 
- identifier of the subject
- A 67-feature vector of mean and standard deviation values
- calculated values

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- data_long - dataset

- codebook.txt - data dictionary

- Data_cleaning_Doug_white_assignment.r - r code to replicate data cleaning

Original Description

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.
